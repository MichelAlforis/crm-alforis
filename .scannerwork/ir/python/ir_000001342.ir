Š€"Produce a sort key for given requirement based on preference.

        As this is a sort key it will be called O(n) times per backtrack
        step, where n is the number of `identifier`s, if you have a check
        which is expensive in some sense. E.g. It needs to make O(n) checks
        per call or takes significant wall clock time, consider using
        `narrow_requirement_selection` to filter the `identifier`s, which
        is applied before this sort key is called.

        The preference is defined as "I think this requirement should be
        resolved first". The lower the return value is, the more preferred
        this group of arguments is.

        :param identifier: An identifier as returned by ``identify()``. This
            identifies the requirement being considered.
        :param resolutions: Mapping of candidates currently pinned by the
            resolver. Each key is an identifier, and the value is a candidate.
            The candidate may conflict with requirements from ``information``.
        :param candidates: Mapping of each dependency's possible candidates.
            Each value is an iterator of candidates.
        :param information: Mapping of requirement information of each package.
            Each value is an iterator of *requirement information*.
        :param backtrack_causes: Sequence of *requirement information* that are
            the requirements that caused the resolver to most recently
            backtrack.

        A *requirement information* instance is a named tuple with two members:

        * ``requirement`` specifies a requirement contributing to the current
          list of candidates.
        * ``parent`` specifies the candidate that provides (depended on) the
          requirement, or ``None`` to indicate a root requirement.

        The preference could depend on various issues, including (not
        necessarily in this order):

        * Is this package pinned in the current resolution result?
        * How relaxed is the requirement? Stricter ones should probably be
          worked on first? (I don't know, actually.)
        * How many possibilities are there to satisfy this requirement? Those
          with few left should likely be worked on first, I guess?
        * Are there any known conflicts for this requirement? We should
          probably work on those with the most known conflicts.

        A sortable value should be returned (this will be used as the ``key``
        parameter of the built-in sorting function). The smaller the value is,
        the more preferred this requirement is (i.e. the sorting function
        is called with ``reverse=False``).
