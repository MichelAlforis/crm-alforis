´ª"Find all possible candidates that satisfy the given constraints.

        :param identifier: An identifier as returned by ``identify()``. All
            candidates returned by this method should produce the same
            identifier.
        :param requirements: A mapping of requirements that all returned
            candidates must satisfy. Each key is an identifier, and the value
            an iterator of requirements for that dependency.
        :param incompatibilities: A mapping of known incompatibile candidates of
            each dependency. Each key is an identifier, and the value an
            iterator of incompatibilities known to the resolver. All
            incompatibilities *must* be excluded from the return value.

        This should try to get candidates based on the requirements' types.
        For VCS, local, and archive requirements, the one-and-only match is
        returned, and for a "named" requirement, the index(es) should be
        consulted to find concrete candidates for this requirement.

        The return value should produce candidates ordered by preference; the
        most preferred candidate should come first. The return type may be one
        of the following:

        * A callable that returns an iterator that yields candidates.
        * An collection of candidates.
        * An iterable of candidates. This will be consumed immediately into a
          list of candidates.
