            This is called to create a connection instance. Normally you'd
            pass a connection class to do_open, but it doesn't actually check for
            a class, and just expects a callable. As long as we behave just as a
            constructor would have, we should be OK. If it ever changes so that
            we *must* pass a class, we'll create an UnsafeHTTPSConnection class
            which just sets check_domain to False in the class definition, and
            choose which one to pass to do_open.
