÷í"Returns True if :attr:`status_code` is less than 400.

        This attribute checks if the status code of the response is between
        400 and 600 to see if there was a client error or a server error. If
        the status code, is between 200 and 400, this will return True. This
        is **not** a check to see if the response code is ``200 OK``.
