ÙÍ"Take a collection of constraints, spit out the resolution result.

        This returns a representation of the final resolution state, with one
        guarenteed attribute ``mapping`` that contains resolved candidates as
        values. The keys are their respective identifiers.

        :param requirements: A collection of constraints.
        :param kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that subclasses may accept.

        :raises: ``self.base_exception`` or its subclass.
